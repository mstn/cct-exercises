# Computational Category Theory Exercises

Some classical category theory exercises (see references) built on the top of [idris-ct](https://github.com/statebox/idris-ct).

This is my personal messy playground. I do not guarantee that every file compiles.
Occasionally, I could create PR requests against [idris-ct](https://github.com/statebox/idris-ct).
